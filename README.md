# Detecing Faces

# Overview
This notebook is designed as an introduction to detecting faces using the python library OpenCV. The notebook uses a handful of images of recognizable faces and uses the OpenCV facial detection algorithms to detect the faces that appear in the images. This notebook is hosted on Kaggle and can be found here:   https://www.kaggle.com/code/jarredpriester/detecting-faces-using-opencv

# Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project was to practice and get an understanding of how to use OpenCV, how to use OpenCV's facial detection algorithms, how to put it all together in a notebook.

# What I Learned
Not only did I learn how to implement OpenCV's facial cascade classifier but I was able to research a little bit of how it works behind the scenes. Instead of trying to classify the entire image at once, the algorithm uses stages and applies the classification one stage at a time. I also learned that the facial recognition algorithm is not perfect. It seems that the algorithm is really good at detecting frontal faces but has trouble with faces at an angle. My guess is that the algorithm was trained with only images of frontal faces.

# Dataset Used
The images that are used were collected by me using Google images with the filter of only public domain images. I tried to get a variety of images with different facial angles in order to test some edge cases.
